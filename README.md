# AoC2021

## Structure

Every folder corresponds to one day. It contains:

* `main.py`, the python file which solves the problem
* `sample.txt`, the sample file used for testing
* `input.txt`, the full puzzle input
* `puzzle.md`, a Markdown with the problem described. (Copied from the AoC website)

## Emojis

For commit messages, I picked some emojis for each action:

* Add files: üç±
* Update files: ‚úèÔ∏è
